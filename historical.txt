The history of the past is but one long struggle upward to equality
I came I saw I conquered
The library is the temple of learning and learning has liberated more people than all the wars in history
It takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition
Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering
There are still many causes worth sacrificing for so much history yet to be made
The people and the people alone are the motive force in the making of world history
The prolonged slavery of women is the darkest page in human history
History is the only true teacher the revolution the best school for the proletariat
History is nothing if not an epic tale of missed opportunities
History will be kind to me for I intend to write it
History does not repeat itself but it does rhyme
The first duty of a man is to think for himself
We are all fools in love
Study the past if you would define the future
History is a set of lies agreed upon
Those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it
Those who do not move do not notice their chains
The past is a foreign country they do things differently there
When a man learns to love he must bear the risk of hatred
