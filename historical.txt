The history of the past is but one long struggle upward to equality
I came I saw I conquered
The library is the temple of learning and learning has liberated more people than all the wars in history
It takes an endless amount of history to make even a little tradition
Never throughout history has a man who lived a life of ease left a name worth remembering
There are still many causes worth sacrificing for so much history yet to be made
The people and the people alone are the motive force in the making of world history
